   PDF reader plus local webDAV server for upload/download of documents

This simple app combines two great open source projects into one:

[PDF Reader](https://github.com/vfr/Viewer) by Julius Oklamcak and [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer) by Pierre-Olivier Latour.

It has a very nice reader for PDF files, and the addition of the WebDAV server gives the option to directly upload/download files onto the App's local directory on the device is running onto.

**For those who don't want to use cloud services, but good-old transfer and management of own files and documents**

## TODO

The code has not been updated since 2017, so there are some deprecations (mostly on UIViewControllers). I initially wanted to rewrite it in Swift and use Storyboards (or SwiftUI), but as usual, time ran up...
